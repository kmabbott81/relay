## 60-Second Demo Script

### Target Audience
Sales calls, webinars, YouTube, LinkedIn

### Script

**[0–5s] Hook**
> "Copilot costs $30 per user per month. Relay costs $9. Same AI, better security, way less expensive. Watch this."

**[5–15s] Price Comparison (Show slide)**
> "For a 100-person company, Relay saves you $31,850 in year one. Plus, no IT setup—no weeks of waiting for SSO. Just Google sign-in. 5 minutes."

**[15–25s] Security Proof (Show live dashboard)**
> "Here's the difference: Your data encrypts before leaving your browser. It's isolated at the database level—not just the app. And we prove it works—every single day."
> [Hover over X-Data-Isolation header]
> "See? These headers show exactly what we're protecting. With Copilot, you get... claims."

**[25–35s] Knowledge Base Demo (Upload file, search)**
> "Upload your company handbook, financial reports, whatever. Search across it with AI. Copilot can't do this."
> [Show search results]
> "Now compare to Copilot—it doesn't have a knowledge base. It's a code tool."

**[35–45s] Full Audit Trail (Show audit log)**
> "Every query is logged with the user who ran it and when. You can export it for your auditors. Data never trains Copilot's models. Cryptographically guaranteed."

**[45–55s] CTA**
> "Start free. 10 queries a day, no credit card. See why 1,000+ SMBs switched from Copilot to Relay."

**[55–60s] End Screen**
