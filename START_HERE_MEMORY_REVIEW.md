## What Is This?

This is a **comprehensive review of how well session 2025-11-11 preserved and documented its context** for future reference. It includes:

1. **Assessment**: How good is the current memory system? (78/100 score)
2. **Analysis**: What's working, what's missing, and why?
3. **Blueprint**: How to implement improvements with production-ready code
4. **Roadmap**: 4-phase implementation plan (102-127 hours total)

## Key Finding: 78/100 - Strong Foundation

Your memory system is **excellent for manual documentation** but has **clear optimization opportunities**:

### What's Working ✅
- **Summarization**: 95/100 - Multiple views (comprehensive, quick, change log)
- **Entity Extraction**: 87/100 - 47 entities documented with relationships
- **Privacy**: 95/100 - Minimal PII, proper encryption
- **Verification**: 90/100 - Shell commands confirm accuracy

### What's Missing ⚠️
- **Semantic Search**: 0/100 - No embeddings or similarity search
- **Knowledge Graph**: 45/100 - Relationships documented but not indexed
- **Automation**: Requires manual effort each session
- **Temporal Decay**: Fixed priorities, no time-based adjustment

## Common Questions

**Q: Do we need all 4 phases?**
A: No. Phases 1-2 give 90% of the value. Phases 3-4 are nice-to-have enhancements.

**Q: How long is Phase 1?**
A: 14-19 hours total (4-6 hours generator + 8-10 hours NER + 2-3 hours schema)

**Q: Can we do this in parallel?**
A: Yes. Phase 1 is independent. Phases 2-4 can run simultaneously with team of 3-4.

**Q: What's the cost?**
A: Mostly development time. Embeddings API: ~$0.0002 per 1K tokens (very cheap).

**Q: Will this break anything?**
A: No. Phase 1 is purely additive. Phases 2+ use separate tables/services.

**Q: Where do we store memory data?**
A: Supabase (already used for product). Costs ~$10/month extra storage.
